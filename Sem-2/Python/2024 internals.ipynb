    "# Q1\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (1)\n",
    "1. **Modules**: Modules are files containing Python code (functions, classes, variables) that you can import into your programs. They help organize code and reuse functionality. For example, you can use the `math` module to perform mathematical operations:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import math\n",
    "   print(math.sqrt(16))  # Output: 4.0\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Built-in Functions**: Python provides many built-in functions that are always available for use, without needing to import them. Examples include `print()`, `len()`, and `range()`:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(len(\"Hello\"))  # Output: 5\n",
    "   print(range(1, 6))   # Output: range(1, 6)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use modules and built-in functions in your programs to leverage existing functionality and simplify your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (2) In Python, the `join()` and `split()` methods are commonly used for string manipulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`join()` Method**: This method concatenates elements of an iterable (such as a list or tuple) into a single string, with a specified separator between each element.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   words = [\"Hello\", \"world\", \"Python\", \"rocks\"]\n",
    "   sentence = \" \".join(words)\n",
    "   print(sentence)  # Output: \"Hello world Python rocks\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, the `join()` method uses a space `\" \"` as the separator to combine the words in the list into a single string.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`split()` Method**: This method splits a string into a list of substrings based on a specified delimiter.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   sentence = \"Hello world Python rocks\"\n",
    "   words = sentence.split(\" \")\n",
    "   print(words)  # Output: [\"Hello\", \"world\", \"Python\", \"rocks\"]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, the `split()` method uses a space `\" \"` as the delimiter to split the sentence into a list of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods are useful for converting between strings and lists, making it easier to manipulate and format text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (3) In Python, there are several basic data types, each serving different purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Integers (`int`)**: Whole numbers without a fractional part.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n",
    "   print(\"Your age is:\", age)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Floating-point numbers (`float`)**: Numbers with a fractional part.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   temperature = float(input(\"Enter the temperature: \"))\n",
    "   print(\"The temperature is:\", temperature)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Strings (`str`)**: Sequences of characters enclosed in single or double quotes.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   name = input(\"Enter your name: \")\n",
    "   print(\"Your name is:\", name)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Booleans (`bool`)**: Represent `True` or `False` values.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   is_student = input(\"Are you a student? (yes/no): \").lower() == \"yes\"\n",
    "   print(\"Is student:\", is_student)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Lists (`list`)**: Ordered collections of items, which can be of mixed data types.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   items = input(\"Enter items separated by commas: \").split(\",\")\n",
    "   print(\"Your items are:\", items)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Tuples (`tuple`)**: Ordered, immutable collections of items.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   coordinates = tuple(map(float, input(\"Enter coordinates separated by commas: \").split(\",\")))\n",
    "   print(\"Your coordinates are:\", coordinates)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Dictionaries (`dict`)**: Collections of key-value pairs.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   info = {\"name\": input(\"Enter your name: \"), \"age\": int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))}\n",
    "   print(\"Your info:\", info)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples demonstrate how to input different types of data using the `input()` function and convert them to the appropriate data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (4) we can compund two or more conditions in python using and,or, not statements\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (5) \n",
    "1. TRUE\n",
    "2. TRUE\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (6) print(value to be printed, sep = \" how to seperate the value\" , end = \"whether we dont want a line/tab\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (7) \n",
    "(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "s = 'qwerty1234567'\n",
    "s[-12:-2:2] #output : 'wry24'\n",
    "```\n",
    "(ii)\n",
    "```\n",
    "s1 = 'this is a this phone'\n",
    "s2 = s1.replace('this','that')\n",

    "# Q2\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (1) Prepare frequency distribution of X\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Define the paragraph\n",
    "paragraph = \"\"\"\n",
    "In Python, the join() and split() methods are commonly used for string manipulation.\n",
    "The join() method concatenates elements of an iterable (such as a list or tuple) into a single string.\n",
    "The split() method splits a string into a list of substrings based on a specified delimiter.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Split the paragraph into words\n",
    "words = paragraph.split()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calculate the number of letters in each word (excluding punctuation)\n",
    "word_lengths = [len(word.strip('.,()')) for word in words]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create the frequency distribution\n",
    "freq_distribution = {}\n",
    "for length in word_lengths:\n",
    "    if length in freq_distribution:\n",
    "        freq_distribution[length] += 1\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        freq_distribution[length] = 1\n",

    "1. the values in python can be swapped in two ways\n",
    "```\n",
    "temp = a a = b b = temp or\n",
    "a = 3 b = 5 a,b = b,a\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. The choice() function in Python is part of the random module. It is used to randomly select an item from a non-empty sequence, such as a list, tuple, or string. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import random\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "random_choice = random.choice(my_list)\n",
    "print(random_choice)  # Randomly prints one of the elements from my_list\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, random.choice(my_list) will randomly select and return one element from my_list.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. typecasting in python is changing the datatype of an existing variable\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = 3.14\n",
    "y = int(x)  # y will be 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (3) Sure! Here are explanations and examples for `insert()`, `pop()`, and `extend()` methods in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`insert()`**: This method adds an element at a specified position in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Syntax:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   list.insert(index, element)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "   my_list.insert(1, 'a')  # Inserts 'a' at index 1\n",
    "   print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 'a', 2, 3]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`pop()`**: This method removes and returns an element from a list at a specified index. If no index is specified, it removes and returns the last element.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Syntax:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   list.pop(index)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "   popped_element = my_list.pop(2)  # Removes and returns the element at index 2\n",
    "   print(popped_element)  # Output: 3\n",
    "   print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 4]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`extend()`**: This method adds elements from an iterable (e.g., another list) to the end of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Syntax:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   list.extend(iterable)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "   my_list.extend([4, 5, 6])  # Adds elements of the iterable to the list\n",
    "   print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods provide useful ways to manipulate lists by adding, removing, and extending elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (4) \n",
    "1. The `break` statement in Python is used to exit a loop prematurely. It can be used in both `for` and `while` loops. Here’s the syntax and an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Syntax\n",
    "break\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example with a for loop\n",
    "for num in range(10):\n",
    "    if num == 5:\n",
    "        break\n",
    "    print(num)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example with a while loop\n",
    "count = 0\n",
    "while count < 10:\n",
    "    if count == 5:\n",
    "        break\n",
    "    print(count)\n",
    "    count += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In both examples, the loop will terminate when the variable reaches the value 5, and the `break` statement is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The `elif` statement in Python is used to check multiple conditions sequentially and stands for \"else if\". It is used as an alternative to multiple `if` statements, allowing for more readable and organized code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition1:\n",
    "    # Code block for condition1\n",
    "    statement(s)\n",
    "elif condition2:\n",
    "    # Code block for condition2\n",
    "    statement(s)\n",
    "elif condition3:\n",
    "    # Code block for condition3\n",
    "    statement(s)\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # Code block if none of the above conditions are true\n",
    "    statement(s)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- The `if` statement checks the first condition. If it is `True`, its code block is executed, and the rest of the conditions are skipped.\n",
    "- If the first condition is `False`, the `elif` statement checks the next condition. If it is `True`, its code block is executed, and the rest are skipped.\n",
    "- This process continues for any additional `elif` conditions.\n",
    "- If none of the conditions are `True`, the `else` block is executed, if present.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "temperature = 25\n",
    "\n",
    "if temperature > 30:\n",
    "    print(\"It's hot outside!\")\n",
    "elif temperature > 20:\n",
    "    print(\"It's warm outside.\")\n",
    "elif temperature > 10:\n",
    "    print(\"It's cool outside.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"It's cold outside.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the program checks the temperature and prints an appropriate message based on the conditions. Since the temperature is 25, it will print \"It's warm outside.\" because the second `elif` condition is `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The `while` loop in Python repeatedly executes a block of code as long as the specified condition remains `True`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while condition:\n",
    "    # Code block to execute\n",
    "    statement(s)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "count = 1\n",
    "while count <= 5:\n",
    "    print(\"Count:\", count)\n",
    "    count += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the loop will print the value of `count` from 1 to 5. Once `count` becomes 6, the condition `count <= 5` evaluates to `False`, and the loop terminates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (5)\n",
    "1. The `in` operator in Python is used to check if a substring exists within a string. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "text = \"Hello, world!\"\n",
    "substring = \"world\"\n",
    "\n",
    "if substring in text:\n",
    "    print(f\"The substring '{substring}' is found in the text.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(f\"The substring '{substring}' is not found in the text.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `in` operator checks if the substring \"world\" is present in the text \"Hello, world!\". Since it is, the output will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "The substring 'world' is found in the text.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You can reverse a string in Python using string slicing. Here's how you can do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "original_string = \"Hello, world!\"\n",
    "reversed_string = original_string[::-1]\n",
    "print(reversed_string)  # Output: \"!dlrow ,olleH\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the slice `[::-1]` reverses the string by starting from the end and moving backwards. The first colon `:` means to include all characters, and the `-1` specifies the step to be in reverse order.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. \n",
    "```\n",
    "text = \"Hello, world!\"\n",
    "substring = \"world\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Find the index of the substring\n",
    "index_position = text.index(substring)\n",
    "print(f\"The substring '{substring}' is found at index: {index_position}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (6) Use list comprehension\n",
    "\n",
    "1. L1 = [1,87,27,64,125]\n",
    "```\n",
    "l1 = [i**3 for i in range(1,6)]\n",
    "print(l1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. \n",
    "3. \n",
    "```\n",
    "two_d_list = [['a','b'], ]\n",
    "one_d_list = [item for sublist in two_d_list for item in sublist]\n",
    "print(one_d_list)\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "two_d_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\n",
    "one_d_list = [item for sublist in two_d_list for item in sublist]\n",
    "print(one_d_list)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (7)\n",
    "1. A flag variable in Python is used as a marker to indicate whether a certain condition has been met. It is often used in loops or conditional statements to control the flow of the program. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Check if a number exists in the list\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "target = 3\n",
    "found = False  # Initialize flag variable\n",
    "\n",
    "for num in numbers:\n",
    "    if num == target:\n",
    "        found = True\n",
    "        break\n",
    "\n",
    "if found:\n",
    "    print(\"Target found in the list.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Target not found in the list.\")\n",
    "In this example, the found flag variable is used to indicate whether the target number is present in the list. If the target is found, the flag is set to True, and the loop breaks. The flag is then checked to determine the final output.\n",
    "```\n",
    "2.  In Python, you can use an else statement with loops (both for and while) without an if statement. The else block in a loop executes when the loop completes normally (i.e., without encountering a break statement). Here's an example with a for loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "for num in numbers:\n",
    "    if num == 6:\n",
    "        print(\"Found 6!\")\n",
    "        break\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"6 is not in the list.\")\n",
    "In this example, the else block executes because the loop completes without finding the number 6. The output will be: \"6 is not in the list.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. \n",
    " "
