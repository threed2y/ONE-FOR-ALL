    "# Q1\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (1) In Python, indentation is essential for:\n",
    "1. Defining the structure and flow of code.\n",
    "2. Ensuring code readability and consistency.\n",
    "3. Indicating the scope of code blocks like loops and conditionals.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (2) In Python, Boolean variables represent `True` or `False` values and are used in conditional statements, comparisons, and logical operations. They help control the flow of programs and make decisions. Booleans ensure dynamic and responsive code behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (3) A tuple in Python is immutable, meaning its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed after it is created. This immutability ensures data integrity and reliability in programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (4) Tuple packing involves creating a tuple from multiple values, e.g., `my_tuple = 1, 2, 3`. Tuple unpacking retrieves individual values from a tuple, e.g., `a, b, c = my_tuple`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (5) \n",
    "The `index()` method in Python is used to find the first occurrence of a substring within a string. It returns the index (position) of the substring. If the substring is not found, it raises a `ValueError`. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "text = \"Hello, world!\"\n",
    "position = text.index(\"world\")\n",
    "print(position)  # Output: 7\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the `index()` method finds the substring \"world\" starting at position 7 in the string \"Hello, world!\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (6) You can create a dictionary with the same value for multiple keys by specifying the keys and assigning them the same value. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "keys = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n",
    "value = 1\n",
    "my_dict = {key: value for key in keys}\n",
    "print(my_dict)  # Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 1}\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, each key in the list `keys` is assigned the value `1` in the dictionary `my_dict`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (7) the values in python can be swapped in two ways\n",
    "1. temp = a \n",
    "   a = b \n",
    "   b = temp\n",
    "  or\n",
    "2. a = 3\n",
    "   b = 5\n",
    "   a,b = b,a\n",
    "   \n",
    "#### (8) a = [i for i in range(1,11)]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (9) \n",
    "The `choice()` function in Python is part of the `random` module. It is used to randomly select an item from a non-empty sequence, such as a list, tuple, or string. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import random\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "random_choice = random.choice(my_list)\n",
    "print(random_choice)  # Randomly prints one of the elements from my_list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `random.choice(my_list)` will randomly select and return one element from `my_list`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (10) 'or' operator is used as a logical operator which is used to check any conditon\n",
    "for eg. l1 = [2,3,4,5,5]\n",
    "        l2 = [2.4.5.6]\n",
    "        if a in l1 or l2:\n",
    "        print(\"it is in either if the list)\n",
    "   \n",
    "#### (11) split function is used to split a list into several components it uses delimiter as a parameter\n",
    " \n",
    "#### (12) \n",
    "```\n",
    "str1 = \"Welcome there\"\n",
    "str2 = str1.replace('there','here')\n",
    "print(str2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (13) \n",
    "```\n",
    "d1 = {'jan' : 1, 'feb' : 2}\n",
    "d1['mar'] = 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (14) Lists in Python are mutable and use square brackets `[]`, while tuples are immutable and use parentheses `()`. Lists offer flexibility for changes, whereas tuples provide performance benefits for fixed data.\n"

    "# Q2\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (1) In Python, modules and built-in functions are fundamental components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modules**: Modules are files containing Python code (functions, classes, variables) that you can import into your programs. They help organize code and reuse functionality. For example, you can use the `math` module to perform mathematical operations:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import math\n",
    "   print(math.sqrt(16))  # Output: 4.0\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Built-in Functions**: Python provides many built-in functions that are always available for use, without needing to import them. Examples include `print()`, `len()`, and `range()`:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(len(\"Hello\"))  # Output: 5\n",
    "   print(range(1, 6))   # Output: range(1, 6)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use modules and built-in functions in your programs to leverage existing functionality and simplify your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (2) A flag variable in Python is used as a marker to indicate whether a certain condition has been met. It is often used in loops or conditional statements to control the flow of the program. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Check if a number exists in the list\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "target = 3\n",
    "found = False  # Initialize flag variable\n",
    "\n",
    "for num in numbers:\n",
    "    if num == target:\n",
    "        found = True\n",
    "        break\n",
    "\n",
    "if found:\n",
    "    print(\"Target found in the list.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Target not found in the list.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `found` flag variable is used to indicate whether the target number is present in the list. If the target is found, the flag is set to `True`, and the loop breaks. The flag is then checked to determine the final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (3) The syntax of a `while` loop in Python is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while condition:\n",
    "    # Code block to execute\n",
    "    statement(s)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `while` loop continues to execute the code block as long as the `condition` is `True`. Here's an example to illustrate its execution:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "count = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "while count <= 5:\n",
    "    print(\"Count:\", count)\n",
    "    count += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Execution Explanation**:\n",
    "1. The `while` loop checks the `condition` (`count <= 5`).\n",
    "2. If the condition is `True`, the code block inside the loop is executed.\n",
    "3. The statement `print(\"Count:\", count)` prints the current value of `count`.\n",
    "4. The statement `count += 1` increments `count` by 1.\n",
    "5. The loop condition is checked again, and steps 2-4 repeat until the condition becomes `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the loop prints the values of `count` from 1 to 5. When `count` becomes 6, the condition `count <= 5` evaluates to `False`, and the loop terminates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (4) The `elif` statement in Python is used to check multiple conditions sequentially. The syntax is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition1:\n",
    "    # Code block for condition1\n",
    "    statement(s)\n",
    "elif condition2:\n",
    "    # Code block for condition2\n",
    "    statement(s)\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # Code block if none of the above conditions are true\n",
    "    statement(s)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "temperature = 25\n",
    "\n",
    "if temperature > 30:\n",
    "    print(\"It's hot outside!\")\n",
    "elif temperature > 20:\n",
    "    print(\"It's warm outside.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"It's cool outside.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, if the temperature is greater than 30, it prints \"It's hot outside!\" If the temperature is greater than 20 but not more than 30, it prints \"It's warm outside.\" Otherwise, it prints \"It's cool outside.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (5) \n",
    "```\n",
    "List of exams passed by the candidate\n",
    "exams = [\"Math\", \"Science\", \"History\", \"English\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "#List of grades obtained in each exam\n",
    "grades = [\"A\", \"B+\", \"A-\", \"B\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "#Creating a dictionary using the two lists\n",
    "exam_grades = {exams[i]: grades[i] for i in range(len(exams))}\n",
    "\n",
    "print(exam_grades)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (6) Dictionaries in Python are essential for storing key-value pairs, allowing for efficient data retrieval and manipulation. They are useful when you need to associate specific values with unique keys, such as storing information about an object, configuration settings, or mapping identifiers to data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Creating a dictionary to store student grades\n",
    "student_grades = {\n",
    "    \"Alice\": \"A\",\n",
    "    \"Bob\": \"B+\",\n",
    "    \"Charlie\": \"A-\",\n",
    "    \"David\": \"B\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing a value using a key\n",
    "print(student_grades[\"Alice\"])  # Output: A\n",
    "\n",
    "# Adding a new key-value pair\n",
    "student_grades[\"Eve\"] = \"B+\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Updating an existing value\n",
    "student_grades[\"Bob\"] = \"A\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Printing the updated dictionary\n",
    "print(student_grades)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the dictionary `student_grades` stores student names as keys and their corresponding grades as values. This allows for quick access, updates, and additions to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (7) \n",
    "append in a list means adding a varaible in a list as it is\n",
    "extend is used to add multiple elements in the list as elements in a list\n",
    "In Python, `append()` and `extend()` are used to add elements to a list, but they work differently:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`append()`**: Adds a single element to the end of the list.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "   my_list.append(4)\n",
    "   print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`extend()`**: Adds elements from an iterable (e.g., another list) to the end of the list.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "   my_list.extend([4, 5])\n",
    "   print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `append()` for a single element and `extend()` for multiple elements from an iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (8) \n",
    "```\n",
    "# Define two sets\n",
    "set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n",
    "set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}\n",
    "\n",
    "#Find the symmetric difference\n",
    "sym_diff = set1 ^ set2  # or use set1.symmetric_difference(set2)\n",
    "print(\"Symmetric Difference:\", sym_diff)  # Output: {1, 2, 5, 6}\n",
    "\n",
    "#Check if set1 is a subset of set2\n",
    "is_subset = set1.issubset(set2)\n",
    "print(\"Is set1 a subset of set2?\", is_subset)  # Output: False\n",
    "\n",
    "#Check if set2 is a subset of set1\n",
    "is_subset = set2.issubset(set1)\n",
    "print(\"Is set2 a subset of set1?\", is_subset)  # Output: False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (9) two or more different strings can be joined through + operator\n",
    "```\n",
    "str1 = \"Hello, \"\n",
    "str2 = \"world!\"\n",
    "result = str1 + str2\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: \"Hello, world!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The join() method in Python is used to concatenate elements of an iterable (such as a list or tuple) into a single string, with a specified separator between each element.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Joining a list of words with spaces\n",
    "```\n",
    "words = [\"Hello\", \"world\", \"Python\", \"rocks\"]\n",
    "sentence = \" \".join(words)\n",
    "print(sentence)  # Output: \"Hello world Python rocks\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (10) You can flatten a two-dimensional list into a one-dimensional list using list comprehension in Python. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "two_d_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\n",
    "one_d_list = [item for sublist in two_d_list for item in sublist]\n",
    "print(one_d_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the list comprehension iterates through each sublist and then through each item in the sublist to create a single, flattened list.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (11) \n",
    "In Python, you can use an `else` statement with loops (both `for` and `while`) without an `if` statement. The `else` block in a loop executes when the loop completes normally (i.e., without encountering a `break` statement). Here's an example with a `for` loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "for num in numbers:\n",
    "    if num == 6:\n",
    "        print(\"Found 6!\")\n",
    "        break\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"6 is not in the list.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `else` block executes because the loop completes without finding the number 6. The output will be: \"6 is not in the list.\"\n"
