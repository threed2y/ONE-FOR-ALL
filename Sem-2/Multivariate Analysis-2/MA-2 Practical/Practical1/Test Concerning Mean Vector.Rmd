Q.1 In a study of market structure of firms four variables that determine a firm’s 
market structure are: 
X1: Market share at a given time  
X2: Firm Size (Natural logarithm of net total assets) 
X3: Rate of return on capital 
X4: Growth (% Change in total revenue during a given period) 
Data were obtained on a sample of N= 231 large U.S. firms during 1960 – 1961. 
The sample mean vector is  =(20.92, 8.06, 11.78, 1.09)′ 
The covariance matrix are  
S = V/n = 

.𝟐𝟔𝟎 𝟎.𝟎𝟖𝟎 𝟏.𝟔𝟑𝟗 𝟎.𝟏𝟓𝟔
𝟏.𝟓𝟏𝟑 −𝟎.𝟐𝟐𝟐 −𝟎.𝟎𝟏𝟗
𝟐𝟔.𝟔𝟐𝟔 𝟐.𝟐𝟑𝟑
𝟏.𝟑𝟒𝟔
Assuming that the data for the N= 231 firms constitute a random sample from 
a 4 variate normal distribution, test  the hypothesis that 𝒖𝟎 = (20, 7.5, 10, 2) 

```{r}
s_upper_tri = matrix(c(0.260, 0.080, 1.639, 0.156, 0, 1.513, -0.222, -0.019, 0, 0, 26.626, 2.233, 0, 0, 0, 1.346), ncol = 4, nrow = 4, byrow = TRUE)
    
s_matrix = s_upper_tri + t(s_upper_tri) - diag(diag(s_upper_tri))
print("The given Variance-Covariance matrix is")
print(s_matrix)

N = 231
P = 4                   

sample_mean = c(20.92, 8.06, 11.78, 1.09)
null_pop_mean = c(20, 7.5, 10, 2)

hotelling_t1 = N*t(sample_mean - null_pop_mean) %*% solve(s_matrix) %*% (sample_mean - null_pop_mean)
hotelling_t1

t_cal = ((N-P)*hotelling_t1)/(P*(N-1))
t_cal 
t_tab = qf(1-0.05, P, (N-P))
t_tab

if (t_cal > t_tab) {
  print("We reject the null hypothesis at 5% level of Significance")
} else {
  print("We do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis at 5% level of Significance")}
```
Q.2 Use the Weights of cork deposits Data 

```{r}
data_cork = read.csv("C:/Users/statlab/Desktop/AlokPrev/Multivariate/M.A.-3WEIGHTS OF CORK DATA.csv")

matrix_data = as.matrix(data_cork)

N = nrow(matrix_data)
P = ncol(matrix_data)

cov_matrix = cov(data)
cov_matrix

mean_matrix = colMeans(data)
mean_matrix

contrast_matrix = cbind(diag(3), -1)
contrast_matrix

y_bar = contrast_matrix %*% mean_matrix
y_bar

y_cov = contrast_matrix %*% cov_matrix %*% t(contrast_matrix)
y_cov
 
hotelling_t2 = N %*% t(y_bar) %*% solve(y_cov) %*% (y_bar)
hotelling_t2

t_tab = qf(1-0.05, P-1, N-P)
t_tab


```
```{r}
data_respiratory = read.csv("C:/Users/statlab/Desktop/AlokPrev/Multivariate/M.A.-3RESPIRATORY DATA.csv")

matrix_data2 = as.matrix(data_respiratory)

N = nrow(matrix_data2)
P = ncol(matrix_data2)
```
