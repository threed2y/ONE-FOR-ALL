Question 1:
Data on brother's 
For the data "head length and breadth of brother's"
X1: Head length of first son 
X2: Head breadth of first son
X3: Head length of second son
X4: Head breadth of second son

```{r}
data = read.csv("C:\\Users\\statlab\\Desktop\\AlokPrev\\Multivariate\\Practical4\\practical-6 Brother's  Data.csv")

#Hypothesis
# H0 : There is no difference between the measurements and characteristics of the first son and second son.
# H1 : There is a significant difference between the measurements and characteristics of the first son and second son.

#mean of the columns
mean_data = colMeans(data)
mean_data


#variance covariances matrix
cov_data = cov(data)
cov_data

#partition of mean matrix
mean_first_son = mean_data[1:2]
mean_second_son = mean_data[3:4]

#partition of var cov matrix
v11 = cov_data[1:2, 1:2]
v12 = cov_data[1:2, 3:4]
v21 = cov_data[3:4, 1:2]
v22 = cov_data[3:4, 3:4]

#number of observation
N = nrow(data)
P = ncol(data)/2

#hotelling's tsq
hotelling_t = N * (N-1) * t(mean_first_son - mean_second_son) %*% solve((v11 - t(v12) - v12 + v22)) %*% (mean_first_son - mean_second_son)
hotelling_t

#calculated f
f_cal = ((N - P)/ P) * (hotelling_t/N-1)
f_cal

#tabulated f
f_tab = qf(0.95, P, N-P)
f_tab

if (f_cal > f_tab) {
  print("We reject the null hypothesis at 5% level of Significance")
} else {
  print("We do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis at 5% level of Significance")}

print("Here, as we reject the null hypothesis, we can conclude that there exists a significant difference in the characteristics and measurements of the twin brothers at 5% level of significance.")
