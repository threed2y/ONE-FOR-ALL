Publishing a visualization may mean any of the following:

-   Saving plotly graphs as HTML

-   Embedding a graph within a larger HTML documents

-   Exporting to an image file

In this session, we will discuss how to carry out these tasks.

## Saving as HTML

### htmlwidgets

The `htmlwidgets` package provides a framework for creating a packages that provides an R interface to a Javascript library. The `plotly` package is one such example of an `htmlwidgets` package. A widget made using any such package is referred to an an htmlwidget.

An htmlwidget can be saved as a standalone HTML file using the `htmlwidgets::saveWidget` function. By default, this function produces a completely self-contained HTML file, meaning that all the necessary JavaScript and CSS dependency files are bundled inside the resultant HTML file.

Let's first create a plotly visualization.

```{r}
library(plotly)
p = plot_ly(data = economics, x = ~date) %>%
    add_trace(
      y = ~uempmed,
      type = "scatter",
      mode = "markers",
      name = "unemployment",
      marker = list(color = "blue")
    ) %>%   
    add_trace(
      type = "scatter",
      mode = "lines",
      y = ~fitted(loess(uempmed ~ as.numeric(date))),
      name = "Loess",
      line = list(color = "red", dash = "dashed")
    ) %>%
    layout(
      title = "Unemployment",
      xaxis = list( 
                title = "Time",
                showgrid = F
              ),
      yaxis = list(
              title = "uidx"
              )
    )
p
```

Now we save this graph (the `plotly` object) as an html file using the following code.'

```{r}
library(htmlwidgets)
saveWidget(p, "unemployment.html")
```

Since the resultant html file is a self contained html file, it is quite a big file. If we want to create a smaller html file that saves all dependencies stored in a separate folder, we can use the following code.

```{r}
saveWidget(p, "unemployment2.html", selfcontained = F, libdir = "unemplib")
```

The file "unemployment2.html" is much smaller in size as compared to the file "unemployment.html". However, in this case, if we want to share the `html` file with someone else, you have to make sure that you also include the `libdir` folder along with the `html` file.

## Embedding within an HTML document

### html `<iframe>` tag

The `<iframe>` tag of html is used to display a web page within a web page. The html `<iframe>` tag specifies an inline frame that contains another html page.

#### The syntax

`<iframe src="url" title="description"></iframe>`

Embedding `plotly` graph using the `<iframe>` element is not only easy, it has another advantage: It prevents any JavaScript and CSS in the container html document from negatively impacting how the `plotly` graph renders.

## Exporting to an image file

### Exporting from browser

When a plotly graph is displayed within a browser window, it also show a modebar containing buttons to allow you to perform some useful tasks. The 'download plot' icon in the modebar will download the displayed graph to a png file, which also uses the height and width of the graph.

These defaults can be changed via the `config` function as shown below.

```{r}
p %>%
  config(
    toImageButtonOptions = list(
      format = "svg",
      filename = "Unemployment",
      width = 800,
      height = 400
    )
  )
```

The other supported static file formats are JPEG, and WEBP.

The static image files can be incorporated in the reports created by word processors such as Microsoft word, or can be incorporated as a static image in a webpage using html `<img>` tag.
