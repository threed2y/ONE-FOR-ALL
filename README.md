## 📌 About This Repository

**ONE-FOR-ALL** is a centralized academic repository that consolidates **all practical work, assignments, computational notebooks, and study material** completed during the MSc Statistics program.

Rather than maintaining fragmented files across devices or cloud storage, this repository functions as a **single, structured academic archive**, preserving coursework in a way that emphasizes **organization, reproducibility, and long-term reference**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose & Motivation

This repository is maintained with the following objectives:

* To systematically organize **semester-wise and subject-wise coursework**
* To preserve practical work using **version control**
* To enable **efficient revision** before examinations and vivas
* To serve as a **reference base** for future academic or research work
* To encourage disciplined documentation alongside computation

The structure and workflow mirror **research-oriented practices**, going beyond mere assignment submission.
