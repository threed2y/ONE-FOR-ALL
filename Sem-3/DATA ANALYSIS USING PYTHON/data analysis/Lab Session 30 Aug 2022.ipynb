    "\n",
    "1. Generate a random sample of size 100 from normal distribution with mean 12 and standard deviation 1.5.\n",
    "2. Crate a Series named 'X' containing this data with indices 'u1', 'u2', ..., 'u100'\n",
    "3. Considering the contents of above series as a population, compute population mean $\\mu$ and population standard deviation $\\sigma$.\n",
    "4. Select a random sample s1 without replacement of size 20 from this population. Compute sample mean and sample standatd deviance for the sample s1.\n",
    "5. Select a random sample s2 without replacement of size 20 from this population. Compute sample mean and sample standatd deviance for the sample s2.\n",
    "6. Select 50 samples, each of size 20, without replacement from the population. Obtain sample means and sample standard deviations of these 50 samples. Store these means and standard deviations in a data frame with suitable indices.\n",
    "7. Obtain summary statistics for the data frame created above.\n",
    "8. Interprete your results.\n",
